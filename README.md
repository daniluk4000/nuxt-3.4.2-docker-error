# Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

If you running linux, please execute `chmod 755 command.sh` to make command.sh executable

I use this config for volumes sync.

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:3001`

```bash
docker-compose up
```

One has volumes inside and the other one doesn't. Both will not work.
